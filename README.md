# imageViewer

Takes a .ppm file (P3 or P6) as an argument, opens a window with the image, and allows you to conduct transformations on it. 

Once open, the commands are as follows:

WASD          - Transformations(pan)
QE            - Rotation (about Z)
OP            - Shear
Up/Down Arrow - Scale

Compile with make
Execute with ezview input.ppm


NOTE: You must download the OpenGL starter kit and implant these files inside.
